- I am a recovering framework skeptic
- Stems greatly from the initial release of the new React docs
- On the day of the new React docs get released, I spent a few hours looking deeply at them and noticed that Vite + React Router was greatly ignored in the recommendations section.
- Next + Remix were heavily highlighted and I became deeply concerned about my path forward with React
- I had a lot of Client Side Rendered SPAs at work I helped maintain and provide architectural guidance around.
- I felt like Client Side Rendered SPA were greatly ignored.
