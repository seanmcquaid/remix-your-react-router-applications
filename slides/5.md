# Remix has improved a lot in the past year!

- Vite, presets, built in test helpers for stubbing
- I spoke with Matt Brophy at Connect.tech in Atlanta at the Gun.io networking event about how much I admired his work
- He broke down for me how SPA mode was dangerously close to being released and that this was going to be the best of both worlds for me
- I could actually use a framework for a CSR app and then migrate to SSR when I needed to
