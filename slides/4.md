# Remix announced their move towards Vite!

- I began to see the light a bit more
- I was scorned by Next 13's initial release
- Ryan + team started explaining the future of Remix in terms of opt in features + gradual migration paths to SSR
- But I was still missing a way to cleanly migrate from Vite to Remix and maintain a SPA instead of going straight to SSR
