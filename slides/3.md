# This bummed me out!

- I wanted my teams to have access to the newest features of React which seemed to point more towards the server with just cause but I didn’t see a clear path forward 
- I really didn’t get SSR when I started my career in web dev so I totally understood apprehension from my team on utilizing it
- I immediately started weighing if we would need to pursue rewrites on products that would benefit from these new features
- I was seriously considering rewriting a few of our products in Next.js 13 but I was really concerned about the level of effort to migrate from a React Router + Vite app to Next.js 13
- I was also concerned about the level of effort to migrate from a React Router + Vite app to Remix at the time due to needing to go straight to SSR
