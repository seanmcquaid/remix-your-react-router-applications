# Using the same framework for either CSR or SSR was a Platform Engineer's dream come true

- I knew that teams of engineers that have only knew of CSR would not immediately see the value in SSR or RSC.
- I did not want people to feel like they NEEDED to use SSR if they just wanted to host static content and SPA mode gave us the option to use the same framework in either use case.
- Allowed other engineers to seamlessly hop between teams without needing to learn specific practices for routing or data fetching.
- We could allow a team to easily own where their app lives with the same framework.
