# This bummed me out!

- I wanted my teams to have access to the newest features of React which seemed to point more towards the server with just cause but I didn’t see a clear path forward with a Client Side Rendered SPA
- I really didn’t get SSR when I first started my career in web development so I totally understood the apprehension from my team on utilizing it
- I immediately started weighing if we would need to pursue rewrites on products that would benefit from these new features
