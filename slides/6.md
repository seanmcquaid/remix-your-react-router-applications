UNTIL Remix announced their move towards Vite, I began to see the light a bit more

I was scorned by Next 13's initial release

Ryan + team started explaining the future of Remix in terms of opt in features + gradual migration paths to SSR which was incredible but the the thing that really sold me was SPA mode being released
