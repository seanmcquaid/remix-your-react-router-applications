# Where were you on the day the new React docs were released?

On the day of the new React docs get released, I spent a few hours looking deeply at them and noticed that Vite + React Router was greatly ignored in the recommendations section. Next + Remix were heavily highlighted and I became deeply concerned about my path forward with React since I had a lot of SPAs at work I helped maintain and provide architectural guidance around. I felt like Client Side Rendered SPA were greatly ignored.
