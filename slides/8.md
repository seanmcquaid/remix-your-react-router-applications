I had to start clearly defining guidelines for when to use a CSR SPA vs SSR for work immediately, I knew that teams of engineers that have only knew of CSR would not immediately see the value in SSR or RSC.
I did not want people to feel like they NEEDED to use SSR if they just wanted to host static content and SPA mode gave us the option to use the same framework in either use case. Which for a platform engineer role like mine, was a dream come true. We could allow a team to easily own where their app lives with the same framework.
